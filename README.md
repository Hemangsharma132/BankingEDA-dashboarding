Banking Data Analysis using EDA and Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing banking customer data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights. The analysis was done using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python and visualized through **Power BI dashboards** for better stakeholder understanding.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for data cleaning and EDA  
- **Power BI** – for building interactive dashboards and data storytelling  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for code execution and analysis  

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Understand customer financial behavior  
- Analyze loans, deposits, account balances, and transaction patterns  
- Identify high-value clients and risk-prone segments  
- Present findings through clear and interactive dashboards  

## 📌 EDA Highlights

- Cleaned and transformed raw data (missing values, formatting, outliers)  
- Analyzed numerical and categorical variables  
- Uncovered correlations between income, savings, and loan behavior  
- Visualized trends using bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and box plots  

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Features

- Loan vs. Deposit comparisons by customer segments  
- Trends in credit card usage and savings behavior  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) like average balance, default rates, churn rates  
- Customer segmentation and branch-wise performance  

## 📢 Insights Delivered

- Identified potential defaulters through behavior patterns  
- Highlighted profitable customer segments for targeted marketing  
- Enabled data-driven decision-making for optimizing banking services
